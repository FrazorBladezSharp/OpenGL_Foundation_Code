# Foundation Code

C++ Code which can be developed in any way you wish

The files here represent a dedicated system for the development of 3D Software using OpenGL.

This code base can be converted to use Vulkan, DirectX, or any other 3D rendering system without too much work.  This can be achieved by re-writing / adding a Platform directory of your choice and adjusting the core Window file to hook into that platform as shown with this OpenGL version.

Currently reconstructing the static library using QT Creator, pro files have been generated.



# Dependencies used :

C++ Standard Libs and

    GLFW3
    ImGui
    spdlog
    glm

# Please Note:

    These are raw code files which should be improved upon and are not to be considered final versions.
      
    You can choose any Development Environment to hold the files, then compile using the tools of that environment.
